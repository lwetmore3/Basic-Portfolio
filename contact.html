			<p>Lisa Wetmore was born in the Toledo, Ohio area and is proud of her Mid-Western roots. At the age of eight her parents enrolled here in piano lessons. While not initially fun, the lessons helped her develop discipline and a love for music. Practice. Practice. Practice. Fast forward to age twelve and her family moved to the Lakeland, Florida area. This was quite an adjustment for the adolescent. Lisa continued in school, and piano, volunteering at church, and added sports to the mix. After graduating from high school and college, she went to work in higher education. She loved working on a campus where people were always learning new things. This motivated her to complete a graduate degree. </p>
